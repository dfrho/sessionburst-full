Below is the step-by-step implementation plan for SessionBurst. Each phase includes detailed steps referencing the relevant sections from the project documents.

# ============================ Phase 1: Environment Setup

1.  Check Node.js installation – run `node -v` and if not present, install Node.js (use latest LTS compatible with Next.js 14) per the Next.js official guidelines. (Reference: Tech Stack & PRD Section 1)
2.  Install TypeScript globally if not already installed by running `npm install -g typescript`. (Reference: Tech Stack)
3.  Initialize a new Next.js 14 project using the app router with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS by running: `npx create-next-app@latest --typescript sessionburst` (Reference: Tech Stack, PRD Section 1)
4.  Configure Tailwind CSS with an Indigo-based theme and include the Geist display font. Create or update `/tailwind.config.js` and import the Geist font in `/styles/globals.css`. (Reference: PRD Section 4, Frontend Guidelines)
5.  Set up a Git repository with branches `main` and `dev` and add branch protection rules in your repository settings. (Reference: PRD Section 1.4)
6.  **Validation:** Run `npm run dev` and check the project’s welcome page to confirm the environment is correctly set up. (Reference: Dev Setup Best Practices)

# ============================ Phase 2: Frontend Development

1.  Create the application layout:

    *   In `/app/layout.tsx`, set up a global layout that imports Tailwind CSS and applies the Indigo theme along with the Geist display font. (Reference: PRD Section 4, Frontend Guidelines)

2.  Create the Home/Dashboard page at `/app/page.tsx` displaying an overview of sessions, login options, and account status. (Reference: PRD Section 3, App Flow)

3.  Develop the Session Creation page:

    *   Create `/app/session/create/page.tsx` with a form that includes a large text field for entering natural language session actions (e.g., "goto", "act", "extract").
    *   Add sample prompt suggestions and a button to save editable templates. (Reference: PRD Section 3 & 4)

4.  Build the Session Logs page:

    *   Create `/app/sessions/page.tsx` that displays a detailed list of session logs. Include filtering options, a search field, and a time series chart for longitudinal analytics. (Reference: PRD Section 4, Core Features)

5.  Implement the Payment & Subscription Management page:

    *   Create `/app/payment/page.tsx` to handle Stripe integrations which show subscription status, payment details, and invoice download options. (Reference: PRD Section 4, Payment Integration details)

6.  Integrate OAuth buttons for Google and GitHub on the Dashboard and Login screens. Use Supabase client (to be configured in Phase 3) and render buttons with clear call-to-action. (Reference: PRD Section 3, Authentication Requirements)

7.  **Validation:** Run `npm run dev` and manually test each UI page to ensure responsiveness across desktop, tablet, and mobile. (Reference: PRD Section 4, Usability)

# ============================ Phase 3: Backend Development

1.  Configure Supabase:

    *   Set up the Supabase project and configure environment variables in a `.env.local` file for Supabase URL and API keys. Create `/lib/supabaseClient.ts` to initialize the client. (Reference: PRD Section 5, Tech Stack)

2.  Implement User Authentication & OAuth:

    *   Integrate Supabase authentication in the Next.js app. Ensure Google and GitHub OAuth providers are set up in your Supabase dashboard. (Reference: PRD Section 4, Authentication & OAuth)

3.  Develop API route for processing session actions:

    *   Create `/app/api/sessions/route.ts` (or under `/pages/api/sessions.ts` if preferred) to receive POST requests with the session actions input by the user. In this endpoint, connect with the BrowserBase Stagehand API by calling its endpoint with the received instructions. (Reference: PRD Section 3 & 4, Tech Stack: BrowserBase Stagehand API)

4.  Create API endpoints for session logging:

    *   In the same API or separate endpoints (e.g. `/app/api/logs/route.ts`), implement POST requests to store session logs (username, date/time with timezone, session length) into Supabase. (Reference: PRD Section 4, Session Logging Details)

5.  Implement Stripe integration endpoints:

    *   Create `/app/api/stripe/webhook.ts` to handle Stripe webhook events for subscription events.
    *   Develop additional endpoints as needed for initializing checkout sessions and invoice downloads. (Reference: PRD Section 4, Payment & Subscription Management)

6.  Provide an Admin API route to add new users via Supabase, e.g. `/app/api/admin/addUser.ts`, enforcing validation that only admin level requests can perform this action. (Reference: Q&A: User Permissions)

7.  **Validation:** Test each API endpoint using Postman or curl. For example, test session creation with: `curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/sessions -d '{"actions": "goto, act, extract"}'` and verify response and Supabase storage. (Reference: PRD Section 2 & 3)

# ============================ Phase 4: Integration

1.  Connect Frontend to Backend:

    *   In the Session Creation page (`/app/session/create/page.tsx`), implement a form submission handler using fetch or Axios to call the POST `/api/sessions` endpoint. (Reference: App Flow Document, Frontend Guidelines)

2.  Integrate OAuth with Supabase in the frontend by using the Supabase client to trigger authentication flows for Google and GitHub. (Reference: PRD Section 4, Authentication & OAuth)

3.  Wire up Stripe payment integrations:

    *   On the Payment page, add client-side calls to your custom API endpoints that manage checkout and invoice downloads. (Reference: Q&A: Stripe Integration)

4.  Integrate PostHog analytics by including the PostHog tracking snippet in the global layout (e.g. in `/app/layout.tsx`) to capture user events and trigger surveys. (Reference: PRD Section 4, Analytics & Feedback)

5.  Ensure the Admin functionality is linked by providing a UI element (visible only to admin users) that calls the add-user API. (Reference: Q&A: User Permissions)

6.  **Validation:** Manually simulate a complete session creation flow via the UI. Confirm that session actions trigger the backend API calls, Supabase logs are updated, Stripe subscriptions work, and PostHog records analytics. (Reference: PRD Section 3 & 4)

# ============================ Phase 5: Deployment

1.  Set Up Deployment Environment:

    *   Create a production build with `npm run build` and ensure no build errors occur. (Reference: PRD Section 6.2)

2.  Deploy the Next.js app using your preferred cloud provider. For example, set up a Vercel project linked to your GitHub repository. Configure environment variables (Supabase keys, Stripe keys, BrowserBase API keys) in Vercel. (Reference: Tech Stack: Deployment)

3.  Update domain settings: Configure the base domain as required for session actions within deployed environment settings. (Reference: PRD Section 3, Base Domain requirement)

4.  **Validation:** Access the production URL and run end-to-end tests, verifying authentication, session creation, payment processing, and analytics integration. (Reference: Q&A: Pre-Launch Checklist)

# ============================ Phase 6: Post-Launch

1.  Monitor Application Performance:

    *   Integrate monitoring (e.g., via PostHog and any Vercel monitoring plugins) to capture API latency and frontend responsiveness. (Reference: PRD Section 6, Non-Functional Requirements)

2.  Configure Regular Backups:

    *   Set up daily backups of your Supabase database. Follow Supabase’s backup guidelines and configure cron jobs if necessary. (Reference: PRD Section 7.3)

3.  Collect and Analyze User Feedback:

    *   Utilize PostHog surveys to gather user feedback, and adjust the application based on survey results. (Reference: Q&A: Beta Testing & User Feedback)

4.  Prepare Tutorial Content:

    *   Publish a Loom video tutorial and link it prominently in the application’s Help or Tutorial section. (Reference: Q&A: Tutorial Support)

5.  **Validation:** Simulate concurrent user sessions (using appropriate tools) and ensure the system scales without performance degradation. Validate analytics and backup routines through test runs. (Reference: PRD Section 5.4)

# ============================ Edge Cases & Additional Validations

1.  Implement retry logic in the session creation backend route when interfacing with the BrowserBase Stagehand API (e.g. 3 attempts with 2-second delay) to handle potential API rate limits. (Reference: Q&A: Third-Party API Rate Limits)
2.  Add proper error handling and display a 404 fallback page in `/app/not-found.tsx` for invalid routes. (Reference: App Flow: Error States)
3.  **Validation:** Test error handling by forcing API failures and invalid route navigations to verify the retry mechanisms and fallback pages work as expected.

This detailed plan provides the necessary step-by-step instructions for a successful implementation of the SessionBurst application following the specifications in the PRD and Tech Stack documents.
