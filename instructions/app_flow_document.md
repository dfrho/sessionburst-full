# Introduction

This application, called SessionBurst, is designed to help professionals in SaaS analytics simulate realistic user sessions quickly. The main idea is to allow users to input natural language commands, like ‘goto’, ‘act’, and ‘extract’, and then automatically create multiple sessions with randomized contexts such as device type, location, and user identities. The app starts with a freemium model providing a seven-day free trial, and then transitions to a subscription-based service using Stripe. This flow document explains every page and user journey in simple language so that the complete application flow is crystal clear.

# Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

A new user begins by landing on the homepage which offers a clean, inviting interface that introduces SessionBurst and its benefits. The landing page provides clear links for sign-up and login. New users can create an account using email, while also having the option to use Google or GitHub for OAuth-based registration. Once a user selects one of these methods and completes the sign-up form, a confirmation is sent and they are logged in. For returning users, the sign-in page then offers simple forms for email login or direct OAuth sign-ins. In case a user forgets their password, a ‘Forgot Password’ link is available to guide them through password recovery via a secure email link. After signing in, users have the ability to sign out easily from any part of the app through a visible logout option.

# Main Dashboard or Home Page

Once signed in, users are greeted by a centralized Dashboard that serves as the home page. The dashboard presents an overview of all sessions, showing key session metrics and account status including free trial indicators and subscription reminders. The page is organized with a clear header displaying navigation links and a sidebar that offers quick access to the main modules like Session Creation, Session Logs, and Payment Management. The design is clean and modern, using the Tailwind CSS styling with an Indigo-based theme and the Geist display font. Users can easily navigate from this dashboard to other parts of the application by clicking on obvious call-to-action buttons and menu items.

# Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

From the Dashboard, the primary action a user takes is to create a new session. Clicking the ‘Create Session’ button takes the user to the Session Creation page. Here, users see a well-laid-out interface with a large text field for inputting natural language commands. Sample prompts are provided in the input field as hints for entering commands such as ‘goto home page’, ‘act click button’, or ‘extract data’. Users also have the option to save these commands as templates. Once they enter the desired actions, they can configure additional options such as the number of sessions, device randomization (choosing between mobile, tablet, or desktop), user names, and base domain set-ups. When the settings are satisfactory, the user initiates the sessions, and the application calls the BrowserBase Stagehand API to start the actions.

After a session is initiated, users can move to the Session Logs page via a clear navigation option on the sidebar. This page provides a detailed log of each session, complete with username, date and time (with options to display according to user-specified timezones), session duration, and other metadata. Additionally, the page includes filters and a search function so users can narrow down specific sessions. A longitudinal time series graph is available on this page, showing trends and analytics over the sessions, thereby providing valuable insights at a glance. Furthermore, users can export these logs if they require offline analysis or sharing with its team members.

An important secondary feature is the Payment and Subscription Management page. Accessible from the Dashboard, this page details the user's current subscription plan and remaining free trial period if applicable. Users can update billing information, view their subscription status, and download invoices directly through the integrated Stripe system. If the user’s free trial has ended, clear prompts and options guide them through the subscription process. In addition, an admin-specific feature lets administrators add new users or modify existing user permissions.

Additionally, a Tutorial page is available to help new users understand the complete workflow of the application. The Tutorial page features a Loom video that explains how to input natural language commands, how to save and edit templates, and how to navigate the application. This tutorial is accessible from a Help link present on all key pages, ensuring that users know where to find assistance if they need it.

# Settings and Account Management

Users can update and manage their personal information by accessing the Account Settings page. This page allows them to change profile details, update their email or password, and set their preferred timezone. Notification settings are also available, so users can customize alerts related to session completions, subscription renewals, or system updates. For users involved in billing, the Payment and Subscription Management page is integrated into the settings area, providing controls for updating payment methods and reviewing billing history. Upon completion of any account updates, users can easily return to the main dashboard by clicking on the Home icon in the header.

# Error States and Alternate Paths

The application is designed to handle errors and interruptions transparently. If a user enters invalid data in any form, clear error messages are displayed with instructions on how to correct the mistake. In case of network issues or API downtimes, fallback pages inform the user of the problem while suggesting retries later. If a user attempts an action that is restricted, such as accessing admin features without proper permissions, they are shown a message indicating the lack of access and are redirected back to a safe area of the application. These error states are consistent across all pages to ensure that the user always understands what went wrong and what their next steps can be.

# Conclusion and Overall App Journey

SessionBurst provides an end-to-end solution that starts with a simple sign-up process using either email or OAuth methods, moves seamlessly to a Dashboard that provides a comprehensive view of active and past sessions, and flows into specialized pages such as the Session Creation and Session Logs pages. Users can effortlessly input natural language commands to automate session creation, review detailed logs with advanced filtering and analytics, and manage their subscriptions and billing through a user-friendly interface. The journey is designed to be linear and intuitive, ensuring that users can switch between functionalities without any confusion. By integrating support features like the Tutorial page and clear error handling pages, SessionBurst ensures an overall smooth and engaging experience from sign-up to daily usage.
