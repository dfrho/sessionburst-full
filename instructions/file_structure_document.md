# Introduction

A well-organized file structure is the backbone for any successful project. In our SessionBurst application, this structure is designed to ensure that developers can navigate, maintain, and scale the codebase efficiently. With SessionBurst targeting professionals in SaaS analytics with a freemium Next.js web application, maintaining clarity and structure across files not only supports rapid development but also makes collaboration with designers, backend engineers, and other stakeholders much smoother.

# Overview of the Tech Stack

SessionBurst is built using a modern and robust tech stack. We are leveraging Next.js 14 with the app router for our front-end framework, ensuring fast performance and server-side rendering where needed. TypeScript is used for maintaining type safety throughout the application. Styling is handled by Tailwind CSS, relying on an Indigo-based theme and the Geist display font for visual consistency. On the backend, we use Supabase to manage user authentication, session logging, and storage, along with integrations for Google and GitHub OAuth. The application interacts with the BrowserBase Stagehand API to execute session actions, utilizes Stripe for payment processing and subscription management, and integrates PostHog for analytics and user feedback. Each of these elements has influenced our file structure, from distinct folders for components and hooks to dedicated configuration files and directories for documentation.

# Root Directory Structure

At the root level, our file structure is designed to be intuitive and reflective of the project's core functionalities. The main directories include an app directory, which contains our Next.js route definitions that map directly to the key pages such as the dashboard, session creation, session logs, and payment management screens. A components directory contains all reusable user interface pieces that make up the app, while the styles directory is where our Tailwind CSS styling files reside. The public directory holds static assets like images, icons, and fonts that are required for branding and design consistency. A lib or utils directory is present for utility functions and integrations, including API clients for Supabase and the BrowserBase Stagehand API. Additional directories such as config and hooks help in organizing configuration setups and custom React hooks respectively. At the root level, you will also find crucial configuration files like package.json, tsconfig.json, next.config.js, and tailwind.config.js to manage dependencies, TypeScript settings, Next.js configurations, and styling setups.

# Configuration and Environment Files

The project includes several configuration files that are critical for setting up and deploying the application. At the root, package.json and tsconfig.json are used to manage dependencies and TypeScript configurations. Next.config.js helps in customizing the behavior of our Next.js app. Tailwind.config.js contains our custom styling configurations reflecting our Indigo-based theme. For dependency management and environment-specific settings, .env files are used to store sensitive variables such as API keys, Supabase credentials, OAuth client IDs, and Stripe API keys. These environment files ensure that configuration details are not hard-coded and can be adjusted according to different deployment environments, like development or production.

# Documentation Structure

The documentation for SessionBurst is organized in a way that promotes clarity and provides detailed guidance for anyone working on the project. A dedicated docs directory holds important files such as the README.md, which explains getting started, installation, and usage. Additional documentation files include guides on the API endpoints, setup instructions for local development, and contribution guidelines. This organized documentation structure not only serves to onboard new developers quickly but also provides the team with clear references to ensure quality assurance, troubleshooting, and consistent communication across the project.

# Conclusion and Overall Summary

This file structure is designed to support the growth and scalability of SessionBurst while ensuring that development and collaboration are as straightforward as possible. The clear division of core directories helps in managing everything from user interface components and styling assets to configuration files and documentation. Unique elements such as dedicated integrations with the BrowserBase Stagehand API and comprehensive configuration for multiple OAuth providers underline the care taken to tailor the file structure to the specific needs of a freemium SaaS analytics application. Ultimately, this organized approach to file structure helps maintain a high level of code quality and sets the stage for future enhancements and smooth team collaboration.
