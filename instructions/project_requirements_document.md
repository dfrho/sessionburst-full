# Project Requirements Document (SessionBurst)

## 1. Project Overview

SessionBurst is a freemium web application built with Next.js designed to enable professionals in SaaS analytics to simulate realistic user interactions and session data for demonstration and testing purposes. The application allows users to input a series of natural language actions (such as “goto,” “act,” and “extract”), which in turn spin up multiple sessions with randomized parameters like device type, location, and user identities. This greatly reduces the time it takes for demo engineers to generate data from weeks to just a few days, thus streamlining customer discovery and sales processes.

The app is built to solve the core problem of delayed demo setups in SaaS analytics by automating session simulation and logging. Key objectives include providing a user-friendly interface for entering sessions, automating randomization of session contexts, facilitating secure authentication through OAuth methods (Google and GitHub), detailed session logging with export capabilities, and integrating a transition from a free trial to a subscription-based service using Stripe. Additionally, the platform will leverage analytics tools like PostHog to gather user feedback and performance metrics.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**

*   A freemium Next.js web application with a seven-day free trial and a subsequent subscription model.
*   A user-friendly interface for natural language input of session actions, including sample prompts and the ability to save/edit templates.
*   Randomization of session parameters including device type (mobile, tablet, desktop), location, and user credentials.
*   User authentication and account management using Supabase along with Google and GitHub OAuth integrations.
*   Integration with the BrowserBase Stagehand API to process session actions.
*   Detailed session logging that records username, date and time (with timezone support), session length, and additional meta-data.
*   A dashboard/home screen showing session overviews, a dedicated session creation page, logs page with filtering/search, and a payment management screen.
*   Integration with Stripe for payment processing, including subscription management and downloading invoices.
*   Implementation of PostHog for time series analytics and user feedback through surveys.
*   Responsive design optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
*   An admin feature to add users.
*   Tutorial support via a Loom video.

**Out-of-Scope:**

*   Advanced AI-driven natural language processing enhancements beyond the integration of GPT-4o for potential future upgrades.
*   Custom visual branding beyond the specified Indigo-based theme and Geist display font.
*   Extensive role-based access control (only basic admin functionality is provided).
*   Offline functionality or a mobile app version; it's strictly a web application.
*   Deep customization of user permissions or granular admin rights beyond the ability to add users.
*   In-depth customizable analytics dashboards beyond the basic time series data and session logs.

## 3. User Flow

When a new user accesses SessionBurst, they start by signing in using Google or GitHub OAuth. After login, the user lands on a dashboard that provides an overview of their sessions, account status, and navigation options to create new session actions. On the home page, clear call-to-action buttons guide the user to either create a new session or review historical session logs. The dashboard also displays key user account details, free trial status, and prompts for subscription upgrade once the seven-day trial expires.

If the user opts to create a session, they navigate to a dedicated session creation page. Here, they can enter a series of natural language commands (with examples provided) to simulate browsing actions like “goto” or “act” along with “extract” commands. Users are provided tools to save frequently used templates that can be later edited and reused. Once the session is initiated, they can review detailed logs on another page that offers filtering options, search functionality, and time-series analytics showing session trends over time. A dedicated payment and subscription management screen lets users manage billing, view invoices, and update payment details.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance:**

    *   The application should load within 2-3 seconds on standard broadband connections.
    *   API requests (e.g., to BrowserBase Stagehand) should respond within a reasonable time frame to maintain a smooth user experience.

*   **Security:**

    *   Secure user authentication through OAuth with Google and GitHub.
    *   All session data and user information must be securely handled and stored in Supabase.
    *   Payment data handled by Stripe must adhere to PCI compliance standards.

*   **Usability:**

    *   The design must be intuitive with clear navigation across dashboard, session creation, logs, and billing.
    *   Responsive design to ensure usability across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

*   **Compliance:**

    *   Ensure proper handling of user data as per GDPR or relevant privacy laws.
    *   Adhere to industry best practices for secure coding and data storage.

*   **Scalability:**

    *   The backend architecture should handle the growing number of session logs, concurrent users, and session simulations without performance degradation.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

*   **Constraints:**

    *   Dependence on third-party services like Supabase, Stripe, and BrowserBase Stagehand API, meaning their limitations or downtimes can affect the application.
    *   The freemium model enforces a seven-day trial after which users are required to subscribe, so proper handling of state and subscription management is essential.
    *   The application assumes reliable internet connectivity for all critical API calls and integrations.

*   **Assumptions:**

    *   Users have basic familiarity with SaaS analytics and can understand natural language inputs related to session actions.
    *   The targeted user base (sales and demo engineers in SaaS analytics) will find the simulation of sessions sufficient for their demonstration needs.
    *   The development environment includes access to AI coding tools like Cursor to optimize the development process.
    *   Payment processing and authentication integrations (Stripe, Google, GitHub) are assumed to work as expected with their standard configurations.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **Third-Party API Rate Limits:**

    *   The BrowserBase Stagehand API may have rate limits which could impact session creation under heavy loads. Mitigation may include request batching or queuing.

*   **Dependency Downtime:**

    *   Possible downtime or performance issues with external services like Supabase, Stripe, or PostHog may impact user experience. Using proper error handling and fallback mechanisms is advised.

*   **User Data Security:**

    *   Mishandling of user credentials or session data can lead to security vulnerabilities. Strict adherence to authentication and data storage best practices is crucial.

*   **Responsive Design Challenges:**

    *   Ensuring that the UI provides a seamless experience across a wide range of devices may require extensive testing and iterations.

*   **Transition from Freemium to Subscription:**

    *   Handling the state change after the free trial might be complex, so clear and consistent checks must be built to ensure users are prompted for subscription without disrupting sessions.

*   **Complex User Inputs:**

    *   Natural language processing for session commands may lead to ambiguities. Providing sample prompts and template saving/editing functionalities will help mitigate user errors.

*   **Analytics and Feedback Reliability:**

    *   Ensuring that PostHog accurately captures surveys and usage data will require thorough integration testing and monitoring.
